Bulldozer Price Regression
This repository contains code for a bulldozer price regression model. The goal of this model is to predict the sale price of bulldozers based on various features.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file named bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Upload the TrainAndValid.csv file when prompted in the notebook.
Execute the notebook cells step by step to preprocess the data, build the model, and make predictions.
Dataset
The model is trained on the "Blue Book for Bulldozers" dataset. The dataset contains historical sale prices and various attributes of bulldozers. The goal is to predict the sale price of a bulldozer given its characteristics.

Data Preprocessing
The notebook performs several preprocessing steps on the dataset, including:

Parsing the date column and creating new date-related features.
Handling missing data by filling numerical missing values with the median and converting categorical variables into numerical format.
Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
Model Building
The model used in this notebook is a Random Forest Regressor from scikit-learn. The notebook initializes the model, fits it to the training data, and evaluates its performance.

Conclusion
The notebook provides a basic framework for building a bulldozer price regression model. Further improvements and fine-tuning can be done to enhance the model's performance.
